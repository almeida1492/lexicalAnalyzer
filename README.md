# lexicalAnalyzer
This repository contains a lexical analyzer for the PLM language. It is written in C and it is part of the course Compilers of the University of the Northern Rio de Janeiro - UENF
The program reads the code from a txt file, analyze its lexemes, classifies them and prints the tokens in a output file, which is going to be used by the next tool, the syntactic analyzer, in order to continue the compilation process.
